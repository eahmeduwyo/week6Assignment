Visit https://eahmeduwyo.github.io/week6Assignment/ to see the Map

In myStuff in obj.js I have added my information (There is a surprise at the last).

Symobology of point symbols have been changed as well as formatting the popup. Behavior of the sceneView also has been altered.

Also Added the function for Zoom  to the point (Originally the map had its own zoom feature).

Clustering effect also has been created (Implemented feature reduction for dense areas).

Search Bar has also been added. Only four Cities currently: Denver, Cheyenne, Casper, Laramie
